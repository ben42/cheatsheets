== Replication

=== Types of Replication

* Synchronous: high consistency, high latency
* Asynchronous: low consistency, low latency
* Chain Replication


=== Log Replication Strategies

* Statement based
** won't work for nondeterministic functions in statements
* Write ahead log
* Row based
* Trigger-based


=== Leader Election

* Leader-based
* Multi leader
* Leaderless


=== Replication Lag, consistencies

* Read-after-write consistency: see your own writes immediately
* Monotonic reads: ensures not going backward in time when reading from different replicas
* Consistent prefix reads: an observer should see a sequence of write operation in the order they were executed


== Distributed Consensus

Algorithms

* Paxos
* ZAB (ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast)
* Raft: NATS.io Streaming
* Chandraâ€“Toueg
