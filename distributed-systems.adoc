== Replication

=== Types of Replication

* Synchronous: high consistency, high latency
* Asynchronous: low consistency, low latency
* Chain Replication


=== Log Replication Strategies

* Statement based
** won't work for nondeterministic functions in statements
* Write ahead log
* Row based
* Trigger-based


=== Replication Lag, consistencies

* Read-after-write consistency: see your own writes immediately
* Monotonic reads: ensures not going backward in time when reading from different replicas
* Consistent prefix reads: an observer should see a sequence of write operation in the order they were executed


== Replicaiton Architectures 

Single leader

* Straightforward, conflictless
* Failover needed when leader goes down (reelection, client switches to new leder, followers follows the new leader)
* Strong ordering guarantees possible
* Leader may be bottleneck for writes
* Every write go through single centralized leader may lead to high latencies
* Examples of leaderless architectures: Kafka, RabbitMQ

Multi leader

* Write conflicts must be handled
* Good for geographically distribution, spreading cluster over multiple datacenter or for clients with long offline periods (leader will be a part of the clients)
* Load balanced write operations
* Low latencies for r+w operations of clients
* Great way for geographically distributed clusters with high latencies between locations. Leader per datacenter
* Possible solution for clients (leaders) witch longer offline periods
* Examples of Multi leader architectures: CouchDB, VoltDB

Leaderless

* No ordering guarantees
* Failovers are not needed
* Read and write operations are Quorum based (majority of nodes must be available)
* Clients writes data directly and parallel to a defined number (RF) of nodes in the cluster or to a designated coordinator in the cluster (client- or server-side replication)
* Catching up missed writes between brokers:
** Read Repair: Clients reads data from all the nodes the data was written to and compares the results. If the data of some nodes is outdated, the clients itself writes the newest state of the data to the node. Works only well for values that are frequently read.
** Anti entropy process: Serverside background job which synchronizes the data between the brokers.
* Examples of leaderless architectures: Cassandra, Voldemort, Dynamo (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_(storage_system))

== Distributed Consensus

Algorithms

* Paxos
* ZAB (ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast)
* Raft: NATS.io Streaming (https://raft.github.io)
* Chandraâ€“Toueg


== Partitioning

* In DBs known as Sharding
* Balance network i/o, disk i/o and data usage among multiple nodes in a distributed system
* Goal is to distribute load evenly over nodes. Depends on the partitioning algorithm used.
* Partitioning of key-value structured data
** Hash of keys: Mostly even distribution between partitions
** Key ranges: Distribution may be skewed, allows efficient key based range queries
** Dynamic extended keys: Some "hot" keys may occur more than others. Keys will be extended by a random number. Must be handled client-side.
